%As we move toward an exascale future with ever expanding capacities in terms of both cores and resources, we have reached a point in high performance computing where current execution paradigms will no-longer suffice. With the multiplicity of transistors and components comes ever increasing power requirements which necessarily result in the need for a fundamental and radical shift in both terms of programmability and adaptation. We believe that system runtimes will need to become hierarchically introspective and self-aware to be able adapt to the steep performance and energy requirements of these future systems. To this end, this document explores the major hardware requirements we believe are central to enabling introspection, the types of interfaces and information that will be needed for introspective system runtimes, and discusses a research path toward a self-aware system for exascale architectures.      

High-performance systems are evolving to a point where performance is no longer the sole relevant criterion anymore. Current execution and resource management paradigms are no longer sufficient to ensure correctness and performance. Power requirements are presently driving the co-design of HPC systems, which in turn sets the course for a radical change in how to express the need for scarcer and scarcer resources, as well as, how to manage them. As a result, systems will need to become more introspective and self-aware with respect to performance, energy, and resiliency. To this end, this thesis explores the major hardware requirements that are central to enabling introspection, the types of interfaces and information that will be needed for introspective system software, provides an abstract representation of exascale architectures based on current trends, and implements an exascale simulation framework with built in temperature and power management capabilities. Through this framework, we demonstrate that localized adaptive policies are not sufficient for exascale systems and that instead coordinated hierarchical adaptive policies are need in order to effectively adapt and mitigate oscillation within systems consisting of thousands of independent cores.
